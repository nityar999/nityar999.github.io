<p>I'm a PhD student in the Computer Science deptartment at the University of Maruyland, College Park.</p>

<p>Prior to beginning my PhD I completed  the University of California, Irvine. Earlier I was an undergraduate at Carnegie Mellon University where I studied mathematics. I also worked briefly as a software engineer at Microsoft.</p>

<p>I'm interested in theoretical computer science and discrete math. My research interests include randomized algorithms, matchings and graph theory.</p>
